# Fake User Generator Project 👥

Welcome to the Fake User Generator project! In this project, I utilized Node.js with Express.js along with the Faker library to generate 100 fake user profiles, each assigned a UUID. The generated data is stored in a MySQL database hosted on the online platform [FreeSQLDatabase.com](https://freesqldatabase.com/). The main point of this project focuses on understanding Database operations and deployment of it on internet.


## Features 🌟

- Generates 100 fake user profiles with realistic data.

- The users can Edit or delete their usernames with the help of their credentials.
